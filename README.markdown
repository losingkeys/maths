# Maths!
Everyone loves math.
That's why I made this app, so you can do math from everywhere!


## Installing
Right now this app just runs on the client side, so you could just download it and point your browser to `index.html`.
To download, just run:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/joshuarh/maths

in your terminal.


## How it works
Right now you can:
* choose addition/subtraction
* choose where to start (adding/subtracting 0s-10s)
* continue on all the way to the bonus round!


## TODO/Plans
In the future, I'd like to:
* Style it!  It's still very much unstyled
* Ensure everything works as expected (grading, next ?, etc)
* Get this working on the server side so classrooms can:
	* track students' progress
	* save their sessions safely, without leaking any students' data
	* view statistics about students' progress so far
	* (as a student) pick up where they left off
* support:
	* multiplication/division
	* printing/emailing graphs (use [the fancy stuff github uses](https://github.com/mbostock/d3))
* test:
	* on phones/tablets/common browsers
